## Setup

This notebook installs all of the packaged needed for the other notebooks.
Click the two green play buttons to start the installation.

```{r}
install.packages(
  pkgs = c(
    "tidyverse", "irlba", "umap", "glmnet", "FNN", "xgboost",
    "tokenizers", "cleanNLP", "udpipe", "topicmodels", "ggrepel", "RcppRoll"
  ),
  quiet = TRUE,
  dependencies = TRUE,
  type = "binary"
)
```

There may be some red text that prints out, but you should not need to worry
unless the screen says the word "Error".
