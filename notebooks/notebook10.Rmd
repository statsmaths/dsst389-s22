## Getting Started

Before running this notebook, select "Session > Restart R and Clear Output" in
the menu above to start a new R session. You may also have to hit the broom in
the upper right-hand corner of the window. This will clear any old data sets and
give us a blank slate to start with.

After starting a new session, run the following code chunk to load the
libraries and data that we will be working with today.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
source("../funs/funs.R")
source("../funs/funs_custom.R")
```

I have set the options `message=FALSE` and `echo=FALSE` to avoid cluttering
your solutions with all the output from this code.

## Reading the Data

```{r, message = FALSE}

```

## Questions

```{r, question-01}

```
