## General Instructions

This page outlines the instructions for the first project. You should
have a file `project04.Rmd` in your RStudio workspace where you can
work on the project. I find that students prefer having a consistent
format for the projects, so I will attempt to keep the format the same
throughout the semester.

On the due-date, your group is responsible for completing two elements:

1. Slides presenting your results, also submitted in your Box folder.
2. A presentation based on your slide show. This should be between 10 and 15
minutes in length.

As described on the syllabus, the project will be graded as either Satisfactory
or Unsatisfactory. I will provide additional feedback that you can address in
the next project.

## Specific Instructions

For this project, part of the assignment is constructing your data set from
Wikipeda. This can be done with the code in `project04-create.Rmd`. Following
the method used in Notebook12, you will start with a small set of pages, and
create a corpus of pages by following the links from those starting page(s).

The choice of starting pages is completely up to your group. You may, for
example, choose to start with one option, and then modify it based on the
initial results. I will come around and make sure everyone is on the right
track. Good options include large, generic pages such as
[History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History),
[Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics),
[Mammal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal), or
[University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University). Other good options include
"list" pages, such as
[Early modern universities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_early_modern_universities_in_Europe),
[Sovereign States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states),
[U.S. Cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population), or
[Fantasy Novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fantasy_novels_(Aâ€“H)).
My code even allows you to work with a language other than English, but please
check with me as I can offer guidance on what other languages are complete
enough (and have good-enough parsers) to work for the project. Ultimately, you
should aim for somewhere in the range of 100-1500 pages.

This project does not have a predictive modeling task associated to it. The
goal is simply to explain your corpus to the rest of the class using the
techniques we have learned, such as topic models, document clustering, TF-IDF,
and KWiC. Consider including interesting visualizations in addition to tables
and keep in mind that it is better to give a focused and interesting
presentation, rather than a boring and encyclopedic one.

## Groups

Each group is free to determine how they would like to create their data set
according to the instructions above.

On the first day (11 April 2022) we will have, in order:

**Group 5**

**Group 6**

**Group 8**

**Group 2**

On the second day (13 April 2022) we will have, in order:

**Group 1**

**Group 3**

**Group 4**

**Group 7**

## Notes

While working through the project, I typically find that many groups ask for
help writing the same bits of code. Any notes that I want to share about how
to do specific tasks will be added here as we work through the project.
